/*
 * mhz.c - calculate clock rate and megahertz
 *
 * Usage: mhz [-c]
 *
 *******************************************************************
 *
 * Caveat emptor and other warnings
 *
 * This code must be compiled using the optimizer!  If you don't
 * compile this using the optimizer, then many compilers don't
 * make good use of the registers and your inner loops end up
 * using stack variables, which is SLOW.  
 *
 * Also, it is sensitive to other processor load.  When running
 * mhz with "rtprio" (real-time priority), I have never had mhz
 * make a mistake on my machine.  At other times mhz has been
 * wrong about 10% of the time.
 *
 * If there is too much noise/error in the data, then this program
 * will usually return a clock speed that is too high.
 *
 *******************************************************************
 * 
 * Constraints
 *
 * mhz.c is meant to be platform independent ANSI/C code, and it 
 * has as little platform dependent code as possible.  
 *
 * This version of mhz is designed to eliminate the variable 
 * instruction counts used by different compilers on different 
 * architectures and instruction sets.  It is also structured to
 * be tightly interlocked so processors with super-scalar elements
 * or dynamic instructure reorder buffers cannot overlap the
 * execution of the expressions.
 *
 * We have to try and make sure that the code in the various
 * inner loops does not fall out of the on-chip instruction cache
 * and that the inner loop variables fit inside the register set.
 * The i386 only has six addressable registers, so we had to make
 * sure that the inner loop procedures had fewer variables so they
 * would not spill onto the stack.
 *
 *******************************************************************
 *
 * Algorithm
 *
 * We can compute the CPU cycle time if we can get the compiler
 * to generate (at least) two instruction sequences inside loops
 * where the inner loop instruction counts are relatively prime.  
 * We have several different loops to increase the chance that 
 * two of them will be relatively prime on any given architecture.  
 *
 * This technique makes no assumptions about the cost of any single
 * instruction or the number of instructions used to implement a
 * given expression.  We just hope that the compiler gets at least
 * two inner loop instruction sequences with lengths that are
 * relatively prime.  The "relatively prime" makes the greatest
 * common divisor method work.  If all the instructions sequences
 * have a common factor (e.g. 2), then the apparent CPU speed will
 * be off by that common factor.  Also, if there is too much
 * variability in the data so there is no apparent least common
 * multiple within the error bounds set in multiple_approx, then
 * we simply return the maximum clock rate found in the loops.
 *
 * The processor's clock speed is the greatest common divisor
 * of the execution frequencies of the various loops.  For
 * example, suppose we are trying to compute the clock speed
 * for a 120Mhz processor, and we have two loops:
 *	SHR		--- two cycles to shift right
 *	SHR;ADD		--- three cycles to SHR and add
 * then the expression duration will be:
 *	SHR		11.1ns (2 cycles/SHR)
 *	SHR;ADD		16.6ns (3 cycles/SHR;ADD)
 * so the greatest common divisor is 5.55ns and the clock speed
 * is 120Mhz.  Aside from extraneous variability added by poor 
 * benchmarking hygiene, this method should always work when we 
 * are able to get loops with cycle counts that are relatively 
 * prime.
 *
 * Suppose we are unlucky, and we have our two loops do
 * not have relatively prime instruction counts.  Suppose
 * our two loops are:
 *	SHR		11.1ns (2 cycles/SHR)
 *	SHR;ADD;SUB	22.2ns (4 cycles/SHR;ADD;SUB)
 * then the greatest common divisor will be 11.1ns, so the clock
 * speed will appear to be 60Mhz.
 *
 * The loops provided so far should have at least two relatively 
 * prime loops on nearly all architectures.
