Thanks very much for filling this out.   The system will save it across
runs so that you don't have to do it again unless you change what you
are measuring (i.e., add disks to the mix).  The stuff you fill in is
in lower case, the uppercase stuff you should leave as is.

If you used "vi" and you don't know how to use it, just type ZZ and skip
this step.
