.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lat_http
is a client/server program that measures simple http transaction
latencies.  It has its own HTTP server, and it is meant to simply
measure the minimum overall costs of simple HTTP ``GET''
transactions.  It does not measure the performance of third-party HTTP
servers.  
.LP
The client simply makes a series of HTTP GET requests for files.  The
files are a fixed set of files included with the benchmark.  No
special care was made to ensure that the file sizes match and
predetermined distribution.
.SH ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
Funding for the development of
this tool was provided by Sun Microsystems Computer Corporation.
