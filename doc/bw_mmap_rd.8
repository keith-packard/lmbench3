.SH NAME
bw_mmap_rd \- time the reading and summing of a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bw_mmap_rd
[
.I "-P <parallelism>"
]
[
.I "-W <warmups>"
]
[
.I "-N <repetitions>"
]
.I size
.I file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bw_mmap_rd
creates a memory mapping to the file and then reads the mapping in an unrolled
loop similar to that used in bw_mem_rd(8).
The benchmark is intended to be used on a file 
that is in memory, i.e., the benchmark is a reread benchmark.  Other
file benchmarking can be done with 
.BR lmdd (8).
.LP
The size
specification may end with ``k'' or ``m'' to mean
kilobytes (* 1024) or megabytes (* 1024 * 1024).
.SH OUTPUT
Output format is \f(CB"%0.2f %.2f\\n", megabytes, megabytes_per_second\fP, i.e.,
.sp
.ft CB
8.00 25.33
.ft
.SH MEMORY UTILIZATION
This benchmark should move approximately the reported amount of memory.
.SH ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
Funding for the development of
this tool was provided by Sun Microsystems Computer Corporation.
