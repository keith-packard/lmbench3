.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The single most important element of a good benchmarking system is
the quality and reliability of its measurement system.  
.IR lmbench 's
timing subsystem manages the experimental timing process to produce
accurate results in the least possible time.  
.I lmbench 
includes methods for measuring and eliminating several factors that 
influence  the accuracy of timing measurements, such as the resolution 
of the system clock.
.LP
.I lmbench 
gets accurate results by considering clock resolution, 
auto-sizing the duration of each benchmark, and conducting multiple
experiments.  
.TP
.B "void	benchmp(initialize, benchmark, cleanup, enough, parallel, warmup, repetitions, cookie)"
measures the performance of 
.I benchmark
repeatedly and reports the median result.  
.I benchmp
creates
.I parallel
sub-processes which run
.I benchmark
in parallel.  This allows lmbench to measure the system's ability to
scale as the number of client processes increases.  Each sub-process
executes
.I initialize
before starting the benchmarking cycle.  It will call
.I benchmark
several times in order to collect
.I repetitions
results.  After all the benchmark results have been collected, 
.I cleanup
is called to cleanup any resources which may have been allocated
by 
.I initialize
or 
.I benchmark .
.I cookie 
is a void pointer to a hunk of memory that can be used to store any
parameters or state that is needed by the benchmark.
.TP
.B "void	benchmp_getstate()"
returns a void pointer to the lmbench-internal state used during 
benchmarking.  The state is not to be used or accessed directly
by clients, but rather would be passed into
.I benchmp_interval. 
.TP
.B "iter_t	benchmp_interval(void* state)"
returns the number of times the benchmark should execute its
benchmark loop during this timing interval.  This is used only
for weird benchmarks which cannot implement the benchmark
body in a function which can return, such as the page fault
handler.  Please see 
.I lat_sig.c 
for sample usage.
.TP
.B "void	start(struct timeval *begin)"
starts a timing interval.  If
.I begin 
is non-null, save the start time in 
.I begin .
.TP
.B "uint64	stop(struct timeval *begin, struct timeval *end)"
stops a timing interval, returning the number of elapsed micro-seconds.
.TP
.B "uint64	get_n()"
returns the number of times 
.I loop_body 
was executed during the timing interval.
.TP
.B "void	set_n(uint64 n)"
sets the number of times 
.I loop_body 
was executed during the timing interval.
.TP
.B "uint64	gettime()"
returns the number of micro-seconds in the timing interval.
.TP
.B "void	settime(uint64 u)"
sets the number of micro-seconds in the timing interval.
.TP
.B "uint64	get_enough(uint64 enough)"
return the time in micro-seconds needed to accurately measure a timing
interval. 
.TP
.B "uint64	t_overhead()"
return the time in micro-seconds needed to measure time.
.TP
.B "double	l_overhead()"
return the time in micro-seconds needed to do a simple loop.
.SH "VARIABLES"
There are three environment variables that can be used to modify
the 
.I lmbench 
timing subsystem: ENOUGH, TIMING_O, and LOOP_O.
The environment variables can be used to directly set the results
of 
.B get_enough , 
.B t_overhead , 
and 
.B l_overhead .
When running a large number of benchmarks, or repeating the same
benchmark many times, this can save time by eliminating the necessity
of recalculating these values for each run.
.SH "FUTURES"
Development of 
.I lmbench 
is continuing.
