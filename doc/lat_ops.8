.SH NAME
lat_ops \- basic CPU operation parallelism
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lat_ops
[
.I "-W <warmups>"
]
[
.I "-N <repetitions>"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lat_ops
measures the latency of basic CPU operations, such as
integer ADD.  
.TP
integer bit, add, mul, div, mod operations
maximum parallelism for integer XOR, ADD, MUL, DIV, MOD operations.
.TP
uint64 bit, add, mul, div, mod operations
maximum parallelism for uint64 XOR, ADD, MUL, DIV, MOD operations.
.TP
float add, mul, div operations
maximum parallelism for flot ADD, MUL, DIV operations.
.TP
double add, mul, div operations
maximum parallelism for flot ADD, MUL, DIV operations.
.SH BUGS
This benchmark is highly experimental and may sometimes (frequently?)
give erroneous results.
