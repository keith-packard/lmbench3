.I "-W <warmups>"

.I size
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bw_unix
creates a pipe and forks a child process which keeps writing
data to the pipe as fast as it can.  The benchmark measures
how fast the parent process can 
.I read 
the data in
.IR size -byte
chunks from the pipe. Nothing is done with the data in either
the parent (reader) or child (writer) processes.
.LP
The 
.I size
specification may end with ``k'' or ``m'' to mean
kilobytes (* 1024) or megabytes (* 1024 * 1024).
.SH OUTPUT
Output format is \f(CB"%0.2f %.2f\\n", megabytes, megabytes_per_second\fP, i.e.,
.sp
.ft CB
8.00 25.33

.SH "MEMORY UTILIZATION"
This benchmark should move approximately the reported amount of memory.
