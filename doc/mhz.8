.SH NAME
mhz \- calulate processor clock rate
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mhz
.I [-c]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mhz
calculates the processor clock rate and megahertz.  It uses an
unrolled, interlocked loop of adds or shifts.  So far, superscalarness
has been defeated on the tested processors (SuperSPARC, RIOS, Alpha).
.SH OUTPUT
Output format is either just the clock rate as a float (-c) or more verbose
.sp
.ft CB
39.80 Mhz, 25 nanosec clock
.ft
.LP
.B mhz
is described more completely in ``mhz: Anatomy of a microbenchmark''
in
.I "Proceedings of 1998 USENIX Annual Technical Conference", June 1998.
