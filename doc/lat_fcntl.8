.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lat_fcntl
is a client/server program that measures file locking latencies.  The
benchmark alternately locks and unlocks files so that only one of the
client or server is running at a time, similar to ``hot potato''
message passing benchmarks. 
No other work is done in the processes.
