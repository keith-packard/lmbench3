.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lat_fifo
is a client/server program that measures interprocess
communication latencies.  The benchmark passes a message back and forth between
the two processes (this sort of benchmark is frequently referred to as a
``hot potato'' benchmark).  No other work is done in the processes.
The message is passed back and forth using FIFOs.
